        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a student at CodeFellows, I want to be able to learn as much as I so I can become a successful software engineer. This is the start of my portfolio, please be patient as my skillset will grow and I can make edits.</p>

        <h2>Experience:</h2>
        <p>I have a bachelors degree for Anthropology from the University of Washington. I have over 10 years of experience working in customer service from different industries. I have 3 years of experience with clerical work. I grew up touching on HTML and JavaScript, but I never learned in a structured setting. I am hoping to one day become a software engineer after I am finished with CodeFellows.</p>
